Yatta
=====

Little tool I use to introduce creative coding to first-time programmers. See the [demo](http://ariaminaei.github.io/Yatta/examples/ellipson/see.html) and [its source code](https://github.com/AriaMinaei/Yatta/blob/master/examples/ellipson/do.js).

State of the project
--------------------

* Cool to play with, but it's very early in development.
* Main architecture has changed a few times over.
* The API has remained somewhat consistent, but they'll definitely see some change.
* I'm constantly experimenting with perf. That *might* push me to change a few APIs.
* SVG and especially WebGL are definitely better render targets. Sooner or later, they should be implemented.
* We are using this in production, and that won't change, if ever. So, Yatta will be actively maintained, at least for some time.

Getting Started
---------------

Just download the repo and fire up a page in the examples folder. That should get you started.

... or get it with bower:

    bower install yatta

What about documentation?
-------------------------

Yup, that's an issue. I'll write some as soon as I feel good with the API. In the meantime, I'll be posting some demos, so, look at the source ;)
